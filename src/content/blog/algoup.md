description: "My thoughts on building a website for a startup."
---

I am currently working at a robotics startup called Algoup. My goal at Algoup is to build a fully functional company landing page. I will be writing my thoughts working here in this blog post.

## Table of contents

## Premise

Joining Algoup, I was tasked by the founder design, build, and host a company website. There was no required tech stack. The founder asked me that the website must offer a 360 view of products and have a modern theme. You can view the website [here](https://algoup-vert.vercel.app/).

FYI : I am still working on this project as of writing this article.

## Tech Stack

I decided to build the website with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and host it on Vercel. I decided to go with Next.js to maximize SEO and I was fairly familiar with the framework.

Prioritizing development speed, I opted for TailwindCSS to make development even faster and Vercel's hosting as it's easy and straightforward to host a Next.js app on Vercel.

## Result

So far, I've built about half of the website. The content that needs to be displayed is fairly complicated and I have to organize it in a way where it engaging.

I still need to re design several pages, add about 5 new pages, and add responsive styling to over half of the website. As a solo developer who is also working another job, this is a fairly challenging task.

I'm fairly proud of the progress I made so far. My main goal is to first organize the project's goals & deadlines. After this, I will be better able to make consistent progress on the site and finish it effectively.
