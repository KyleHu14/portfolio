description: "My thoughts on building a website for a startup."
---

I am currently working at a robotics startup called Algoup. My goal at Algoup is to build a fully functional company landing page. I will be writing my thoughts working here in this blog post.

## Premise

Joining Algoup, I was tasked by the founder to build and host a company website. There was no required tech stack. The founder asked me that the website must offer a 360 view of products and have a modern theme. You can view the website [here](https://algoup-vert.vercel.app/).

FYI : I am still working on this project as of writing this article.

## Tech Stack

I decided to build the website with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and host it on Vercel. I decided to go with Next.js to maximize SEO and I was fairly familiar with the framework.

Prioritizing development speed, I opted for TailwindCSS to make development even faster and Vercel's hosting as it's easy and straightforward to host a Next.js app on Vercel.

## Challenges

Working at Algoup, I mainly encountered personal challenges rather than challenges related to programming.

### 1. Managing deadlines & tasks.

I really struggled to manage and organize such a large scale project. I used tools like trello and notion but could not figure out a consistent way that I could track problems, features, and progress.

### 2. Lack of coworkers / team members.

I am the only web developer in this startup. Without other team members or developers to communicate and discuss, I felt isolated and did not have a sense of belonging to the company.

### 3. Reporting progress to the founder.

I did not have a consistent system of sending feedback to the founder. The founder was unsure where the development had progressed.

## Overcoming Challenges

I did not have a consistent system of communicating progress and tracking problems.

## Conclusion
