This week I worked on developing the Algoup website, Leetcode, and my personal project. 

## Table of contents

## Algoup

This week, I tasked myself with trying to revamp the News and Manufacturing page of the site. I struggled to complete just the News page. It was hard to revamp the news page. I spent a lot of time thinking what would be the best layout for the News site without it having "a highschooler built this" vibes. My design process was using Figma and looking at the shadcn docs to get inspiration for a modern and sleek design.

## Leetcode

I did several leetcode problems this week. I'd say I did around 4 - 5? This week has mostly been two pointers with a bit of subsets. I honestly have been quite behind on Leetcode, but I teach it on a weekly basis. 

## Personal Project

I've also started to work on my personal project once more. I've started to revamp the themeing and make more use of Shadcn's built in features of switching between dark / light mode.
